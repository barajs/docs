# What is a Bara formula?

Formula is the standalone and independence library that would boost up your functional programming speed.

Each formula is a curry function which is designed to fit with Bara  application.

 As each function is a pure function, you can easily extends or build a new one.

## Future plan

In the future we will distribute every function as a stand-alone package to reduces the size of your application bundle.
